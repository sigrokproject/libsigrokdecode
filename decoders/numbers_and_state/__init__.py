'''
This protocol decoder takes a set of logic input signals, and interprets
their bit pattern according to user specifications as different kinds of
numbers, chars or an enumeration of e.g. machine states.

Supported formats are: signed and unsigned integers, fixed point numbers,
IEEE754 floating point numbers, chars and number to text mapping controlled by
external data files. (Support for half precision floats depends on the
Python runtime, and may not universally be available.)

User provided text mapping files can either use the JSON format:
  {"one": 1, "two": 2, "four": 4}
or the Python programming language:
  enumtext = { 1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three", }

In addition to all enum values on one row (sequential presentation of
the data), a limited number of enum values also are shown in tabular
presentation, which can help visualize state machines or task switches.
